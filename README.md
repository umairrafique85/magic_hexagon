# magic_hexagon

Problem given to me during a job interview, to code a solution for the magic hexagon in R.

Outputs 12 possibilities (which are basically just the one possible solution, inverted in different directions).

&nbsp;&nbsp;3, 17, 18\
&nbsp;19, 7, 1, 11\
16, 2, 5, 6, 9\
&nbsp;12, 4, 8, 14\
&nbsp;&nbsp;10, 13, 15
